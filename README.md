# Maptiles

Maptile is a wonderful Stata resource for making beautiful maps created by Michael Stepner. I have created several geographic templates for Canada at different geographic levels.

Some files are too large for github. I have put the smaller files here, the rest can be found on my website: [link](http://www.iainsnoddy.com). 

## CMAs/CAs
CMAs/CAs are relatively large geographic areas defined as a collection of municipalities (Census Subdivisions) with a core population above 50,000/10,000. Further information on the definition of these areas is available [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo009-eng.cfm) . For the raw Statistics Canada Boundary files see this [link](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm). 

*Available years on git*: 2016, 2011, 2006.

*Available years on my site*: 2016, 2011, 2006.


## Census Subdivisions
Census Subdivisions refer to Canada's municipalities and are defined by law. Further information on the definition of these areas is available [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo012-eng.cfm). For the raw Statistics Canada Boundary files see this [link](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm).  

*Available years on git*: 2016, 2006.

*Available years on my site*: 2016, 2011, 2006.

## Census Tracts
Census Tracts are small geographic areas that respect CMA/CA boundaries and have a population of between 2500 and 8000. Further information on the definition of these areas is available [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo013-eng.cfm) . For the raw Statistics Canada Boundary files see this [link](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm).  

*Available years on git*: 2016.

*Available years on my site*: 2016, 2011, 2006.

## Dissemination Areas
Dissemination areas cover the entirety of Canada and are collections of dissemination blocks with a population of between 400 and 700. Further information on the definition of these areas is available [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo021-eng.cfm) . For the raw Statistics Canada Boundary files see this [link](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm).

*Available years on git*: None.
